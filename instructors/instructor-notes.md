## Tip: Assigning instances to learners

###

We recommend using an online spreadsheet such as Google Sheets to assign learners their cloud
instances, preferably by having a list of available IP addresses, and allowing users to 'claim'
and instance by name. If possible, maintain 1 or 2 unclaimed instances in case some fail to
launch or a learner encounters some unrecoverable error.
