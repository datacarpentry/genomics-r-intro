## "The fantastic world of R awaits you" OR "Nobody wants to learn how to use R"

Before we begin this lesson, we want you to be clear on the goal of the workshop
and these lessons. We believe that every learner can be **achieve competency
with R**. You have reached competency when you find that you are able to
**use R to handle common analysis challenges in a reasonable amount of time**
(which includes time needed to look at learning materials, search for answers
online, and ask colleagues for help). As you spend more time using R (there is
no substitute for regular use and practice) you will find yourself gaining
competency and even expertise. The more familiar you get, the more
complex the analyses you will be able to carry out, with less frustration, and
in less time - the "fantastic world of R" awaits you!

## What these lessons will not teach you

Nobody wants to learn how to use R. People want to learn how to use R to analyze
their own research questions! Ok, maybe some folks learn R for R's sake, but
these lessons assume that you want to start analyzing genomic data as soon as
possible. Given this, there are many valuable pieces of information about R
that we simply wont have time to cover. Hopefully we will clear the hurdle of
giving you just enough knowledge to be dangerous, which can be a high bar
in R! We suggest you look into additional the learning materials in the tip box
below.

**Here are some R skills we will *not* cover in these lessons**

- How to create and work with R matrices and R lists
- How to create and work with loops and conditional statements, and the "apply"
  family of functions (which are super useful, read more [here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/r-tutorial-on-the-apply-family-of-functions/))
- How to do basic string manipulations (e.g. finding patterns in text using grep, replacing text)
- How to plot using the default R graphic tools (we *will* cover ggplot2)
- How to use advanced R statistical functions

## Creating objects in R

> ## Reminder
>
> At this point you should be coding along in the "**genomics_r_basics.R**"
> script we created in the last episode. Writing your commands in the script
> (and commenting it) will make it easier to record what you did and why.
{: .prereq}

What might be called a variable in many languages is properly called an **object**
in R.

**To create your object you need:**

- a name (e.g. 'a')
- a value (e.g. '1')
- the assignment operator ('<-')

In your script, "**genomics_r_basics.R**", using the R assignment operator '<-',
assign '1' to the object 'a' as shown. Remember to leave a comment in the line
above (using the '#') to explain what you are doing:

```{r}
# this line creates the object 'a' and assigns it the value '1'

a <- 1
```

Next, run this line of code in your script. You can run a line of code
by hitting the <KBD>Run</KBD> button that is just above the first line of your
script in the header of the Source pane or you can use the appropriate shortcut:

- Windows execution shortcut: <KBD>Ctrl</KBD>+<KBD>Enter</KBD>
- Mac execution shortcut: <KBD>Cmd(âŒ˜)</KBD>+<KBD>Enter</KBD>

To run multiple lines of code, you can highlight all the line you wish to run
and then hit <KBD>Run</KBD> or use the shortcut key combo.

In the RStudio 'Console' you should see:

~~~
a <- 1
>
~~~
{: .output}

The 'Console' will display lines of code run from a script and any outputs or
status/warning/error messages (usually in red).

You should also notice that in the 'Environment' window you get a table:

|Values||
|------|-|
|a|1|

The 'Environment' window allows you to easily keep track of the objects you have
created in R.

> ## Exercise: Create some objects in R
>
> Create the following objects; give each object an appropriate name
> (your best guess at what name to use is fine):

> 3. Create an object that has this URL as its value: "ftp://ftp.ensemblgenomes.org/pub/bacteria/release-39/fasta/bacteria_5_collection/escherichia_coli_b_str_rel606/"

## Naming objects in R

Here are some important details about naming objects in R.

- **Avoid spaces and special characters**: Object names cannot contain spaces.
  Typically, you can use '-' or '_ ' to make names more readable. You should avoid
  using special characters in your object name (e.g. ! @ # . , etc.). Also,
  names cannot begin with a number
- **Use short, easy-to-understand names**: You should avoid naming your objects
  using single letters (e.g. 'n', 'p', etc.). This is mostly to encourage you
  to use names that would make sense to anyone reading your code (a colleague,
  or even yourself a year from now). Also, avoiding excessively long names will
  make your code more readable
- **Avoid commonly used names**: There are several names that may already have a
  definition in the R language (e.g. 'mean', 'min', 'max'). One clue that a name
  already has meaning is that if you start typing a name in RStudio and it gets
  a colored highlight, or RStudio gives you a suggested autocompletion you have
  chosen a name that has a reserved meaning
- **Use the recommended assignment operator**: In R, we use '<- ' as the
  preferred assignment operator. '=' works too, but is most commonly used in
  passing arguments to functions (more on functions later). There is a shortcut
  for the R assignment operator:
  - Windows execution shortcut: <KBD>Alt</KBD>+<KBD>-</KBD>
  - Mac execution shortcut: <KBD>Option</KBD>+<KBD>-</KBD>


There are a few more suggestions about naming and style you may want to learn
more about as you write more R code. There are several "style guides" that
have advice, and one to start with is the [tidyverse R style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/index.html).

>## Tip: Pay attention to warnings in the script console
>
> If you enter a line of code in your script that contains some error, RStudio
> may give you an error message and underline this mistake. Sometimes these
> messages are easy to understand, but often the message may need some figuring
> out. In any case paying attention to these warnings help you avoid mistakes.
> In this case, our object name has a space, which is not allowed in R. Notice
> the error message does not say this directly, but essentially R is "not sure"

> want is "human_chr_number".

## Reassigning object names or deleting objects

Once an object has a value, you can change that value by overwriting it. R will
not complain about overwriting objects, which may or may not be a good thing
depending on how you look at it.

```{r}
# gene_name has the value 'pten' or whatever value you used in the challenge.
# We will now assign the new value 'tp53'
gene_name <- 'tp53'
```

You can also remove an object from R's memory entirely. The `rm()` function
will delete the object.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# delete the object 'gene_name'
rm(gene_name)
```

If you run a line of code that just has an object name, R will normally display
the contents of that object. In this case, we are told the object is no
longer defined.

~~~
Error: object 'gene_name' not found
~~~
{: .error}

## Understanding object data types (modes)

In R, **every object has two properties**:

- **Length**: How many distinct values are held in that object
- **Mode**: What is the classification (type) of that object.

We will get to the "length" property later in the lesson. The **"mode" property**
**corresponds to the type of data an object**represents**. The most common modes
you will encounter in R are:

|Mode (abbreviation)|Type of data|
|----|------------|
|Numeric (num)| Numbers such floating point/decimals (1.0, 0.5, 3.14), there are also more specific numeric types (dbl - Double, int - Integer). These differences are not relevant for most beginners and pertain to how these values are stored in memory |
|Character (chr)|A sequence of letters/numbers in single '' or double " " quotes|
|Logical| Boolean values - TRUE or FALSE|

There are a few other modes (i.e. "complex", "raw" etc.) but for now, these three are the most important.

Data types are familiar in many programming languages, but also in natural
language where we refer to them as the parts of speech, e.g. nouns, verbs,
adverbs, etc. Once you know if a word - perhaps an unfamiliar one - is a noun,
you can probably guess you can count it and make it plural if there is more than
one (e.g. 1 [Tuatara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatara), or 2 Tuataras). If
something is a adjective, you can usually change it into an adverb by adding
"-ly" (e.g. [jejune](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jejune) vs.
jejunely). Depending on the context, you may need to decide if a word is in one
category or another (e.g "cut" may be a noun when its on your finger, or a verb
when you are preparing vegetables). These concepts have important analogies when
working with R objects.

> ## Exercise: Create objects and check their modes
>
> Create the following objects in R, then use the `mode()` function to verify
> their modes. Try to guess what the mode will be before you look at the solution
>
> 1. `chromosome_name <- 'chr02'`
> 2. `od_600_value <- 0.47`
> 3. `chr_position <- '1001701'`
> 4. `spock <- TRUE`
> 5. `pilot <- Earhart`
>
>> ## Solution
>>
>> 1. `mode(chromosome_name)`    # "character"
>> 2. `mode(od_600_value)`     # "numeric"
>> 3. `mode(chr_position)`     # "character"
>> 4. `mode(spock)`       # "logical"
>> 5. `pilot`     # Error: object 'Earhart' not found
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

Notice from the solution that even if a series of numbers are given as a value
R will consider them to be in the "character" mode if they are enclosed as
single or double quotes. Also notice that you cannot take a string of alphanumeric
characters (e.g. Earhart) and assign as a value for an object. In this case,
R looks for the object `Earhart` but since there is no object, no assignment can
be made. If `Earhart` did exist, then the mode of `pilot` would be whatever
the mode of `Earthrt` was originally.

## Mathematical and functional operations on objects

Once an object exists (which by definition also means it has a mode), R can
appropriately manipulate that object. For example, objects of the numeric modes
can be added, multiplied, divided, etc. R provides several mathematical
(arithmetic) operators including:

|Operator|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|+|addition|
|-|subtraction|
|*|multiplication|
|/|division|
|^ or **|exponentiation|
|a%%b|modulus (returns the remainder after division)|

These can be used with literal numbers:

```{r}
(1 + (5 ** 0.5))/2
```

and importantly, can be used on any object that evaluates to (i.e. interpreted
by R) a numeric object:


```{r}
# multiply the object 'human_chr_number' by 2

human_chr_number * 2
```

Finally, it is useful to know that several other types of mathematical
operations have their own associated functions. While there are too many to
list, you can always search the online documentation in R for a function (
even if you don't know what it may be called in R). For example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
> # search for functions associated with chi squared
>
> ??chisquared
```

Will open search results in your help tab. Of course, using Google will help
here too.

## Vectors

With a solid understanding of the most basic objects, we come to probably the
most used objects in R, vectors. **A vector is a collection of values (numbers,**
**characters, etc.)**. Vectors also have a mode (data type), so all of the
contents of a vector must be of the same mode. One of the most common
ways to create a vector is to use the `c()` function - the "concatenate" or
"combine" function. Inside the function you may enter one or more values; for
multiple values, separate each value with a comma:

```{r}
# Create the SNP gene name vector

snp_genes <- c("OXTR", "ACTN3", "AR", "OPRM1")
```

Two important properties of vectors are their **mode** and their **length**.
You can check these with the `mode()` and `length()` function respectively.
Another useful function that gives both of these pieces of information is the
`str()` (structure) function. Importantly, **items within a vector must all
be of the same mode/ data type**. This is because a vector can have only one
mode. More on this later.

```{r}
# Check the mode, length, and structure of 'snp_genes'
mode(snp_genes)
length(snp_genes)
str(snp_genes)
```

Vectors are quite important in R, mostly for us because data frames are
essentially collections of vectors (more on this later). What we learn about
manipulating vectors now will pay off even more when we get to data frames.

## More on creating and subsetting vectors

Let's create a few more vectors to play around with:

```{r}
# Some interesting human SNPs
# while accuracy is important, typos in the data won't hurt you here

snps <- c('rs53576', 'rs1815739', 'rs6152', 'rs1799971')
snp_chromosomes <- c('3', '11', 'X', '6')
snp_positions <- c(8762685, 66560624, 67545785, 154039662)
```

Once we have vectors, one thing we may want to do is specifically retrieve one
or more values from our vector. To do so we use **bracket notation**. We type
the name of the vector followed by square brackets. In those square brackets
we place the index (e.g. a number) in that bracket as follows:

```{r}
# get the 3rd value in the snp_genes vector
snp_genes[3]
```

In R, every item your vector is indexed, starting from the first item (1)
through to the final number of items in your vector. You can also retrieve a
range of numbers:

```{r}
# get the 1st through 3rd value in the snp_genes vector

snp_genes[1:3]
```

If you want to to retreive several (but not necessarily sequential) items from
a vector, you pass a **vector of indicies**; a vector that has the numbered
positions you wish to retrieve.

```{r}
# get the 1st, 3rd, and 4th value in the snp_genes vector

snp_genes[c(1, 3, 4)]
```

There are additional (and perhaps less commonly used) ways of subsetting a
vector (see [these
examples](https://thomasleeper.com/Rcourse/Tutorials/vectorindexing.html)).
Also, several of these subsetting expressions can be combined:

```{r}
# get the 1st through the 3rd value, and 4th value in the snp_genes vector
# yes, this is a little silly in a vector of only 4 values.
snp_genes[c(1:3,4)]
```

## Adding to, removing, or replacing values in existing vectors

Once you have an existing vector, you may want to add a new item to it. To do
so, you can use the `c()` function again to add your new value:

```{r}
# add the gene 'CYP1A1' and 'APOA5' to our list of snp genes
# this overwrites our existing vector
snp_genes <- c(snp_genes, "CYP1A1", "APOA5")
```

We can of course verify that "snp_genes" contains the new gene entry

```{r}
snp_genes
```

Using a negative index will return a version a vector with that index's
value removed:

```{r}
snp_genes[-6]
```

We can remove that value from our vector by overwriting it with this expression:


```{r}
snp_genes <- snp_genes[-6]
snp_genes
```

We can also explicitly rename or add a value to our index using double bracket notation:

```{r}
snp_genes[[7]]<- "APOA5"
snp_genes
```

Notice in the operation above that R inserts an `NA` value to extend our vector so that the gene "APOA5" is an index 7. This may be a good or not so good thing depending on how you use this.

{: .challenge}


## Logical Subsetting

There is one last set of cool subsetting capabilities we want to introduce. It is possible within R to retrieve items in a vector based on a logical evaluation or numerical comparison. For example, let's say we wanted get all of the SNPs in our vector of SNP positions that were greater than 100,000,000. We could index using the '>' (greater than) logical operator:

```{r}
snp_positions[snp_positions > 100000000]
```

As demonstrated above, in the square brackets you place the name of the vector followed by the comparison operator and (in this numeric case) a numeric value. Some of the most common logical operators you will use in R are:

  | Operator | Description              |
  |----------|--------------------------|
  | <        | less than                |
  | <=       | less than or equal to    |
  | >        | greater than             |
  | >=       | greater than or equal to |
  | ==       | exactly equal to         |
  | !=       | not equal to             |
  | !x       | not x                    |
  | a \| b   | a or b                   |
  | a & b    | a and b                  |

## A few final vector tricks

Finally, there are a few other common retrieve or replace operations you may
want to know about. First, you can check to see if any of the values of your
vector is an NA value. Missing data will get a more detailed treatment later,
but the `is.NA()` function will return a logical vector, with TRUE for any NA
value:

```{r}
# current value of 'snp_genes': chr [1:7] "OXTR" "ACTN3" "AR" "OPRM1" "CYP1A1" NA "APOA5"

is.na(snp_genes)
```

Sometimes, you may wish to find out if a specific value (or several values) is
present a vector. You can do this using the comparison operator `%in%`, which
will return TRUE for any value in your collection of one or more values matches
a value in the vector you are searching:

```{r}
# current value of 'snp_genes':
# chr [1:7] "OXTR" "ACTN3" "AR" "OPRM1" "CYP1A1" NA "APOA5"

# test to see if "ACTN3" or "APO5A" is in the snp_genes vector
# if you are looking for more than one value, you must pass this as a vector

c("ACTN3","APOA5") %in% snp_genes
```

## Bonus material: Lists

Lists are quite useful in R, but we won't be using them in the genomics lessons.
That said, you may come across lists in the way that some bioinformatics
programs may store and/or return data to you. One of the key attributes of a
list is that unlike a vector, a list may contain data of more than one mode.
Learn more about creating and using lists using this [nice
tutorial](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/lists.html). In this one example, we will create
a named list and show you how to retrieve items from the list.


```{r}
# Create a named list using the 'list' function and our SNP examples
# Note, for easy reading we have placed each item in the list on a separate line
# Nothing special about this, you can do this for any multiline commands
# To run this command, make sure the entire command (all 4 lines) are highlighted
# before running
# Note also, as we are doing all this inside the list() function use of the
# '=' sign is good style
snp_data <- list(genes = snp_genes,
                 refference_snp = snps,
                 chromosome = snp_chromosomes,
                 position = snp_positions)
# Examine the structure of the list
str(snp_data)
```


To get all of the values for the `position` object in the list we use the `$` notation:

```{r}
# return all the values of position object

snp_data$position
```

To get the first value in the `position` object, use `[]` notation to index:

```{r}
# return first value of the position object

snp_data$position[1]
```
