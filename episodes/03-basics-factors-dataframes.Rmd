## Working with spreadsheets (tabular data)

A substantial amount of the data we work with in genomics will be tabular data,
this is data arranged in rows and columns - also known as spreadsheets. We could
write a whole lesson on how to work with spreadsheets effectively ([actually we did](https://datacarpentry.org/organization-genomics/)). For our
purposes, we want to remind you of a few principles before we work with our
first set of example data:

**1\) Keep raw data separate from analyzed data**

This is principle number one because if you can't tell which files are the
original raw data, you risk making some serious mistakes (e.g. drawing conclusion
from data which have been manipulated in some unknown way).

**2\) Keep spreadsheet data Tidy**

The simplest principle of **Tidy data** is that we have one row in our
spreadsheet for each observation or sample, and one column for every variable
that we measure or report on. As simple as this sounds, it's very easily
violated. Most data scientists agree that significant amounts of their time is
spent tidying data for analysis. Read more about data organization in
[our lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/organization-genomics/) and
in [this paper](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10).

**3\) Trust but verify**

Finally, while you don't need to be paranoid about data, you should have a plan
for how you will prepare it for analysis. **This a focus of this lesson.**
You probably already have a lot of intuition, expectations, assumptions about
your data - the range of values you expect, how many values should have
been recorded, etc. Of course, as the data get larger our human ability to
keep track will start to fail (and yes, it can fail for small data sets too).
R will help you to examine your data so that you can have greater confidence
in your analysis, and its reproducibility.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Tip: Keep your raw data separate

When you work with data in R, you are not changing the original file you
loaded that data from. This is different than (for example) working with
a spreadsheet program where changing the value of the cell leaves you one
"save"-click away from overwriting the original file. You have to purposely
use a writing function (e.g. `write.csv()`) to save data loaded into R. In
that case, be sure to save the manipulated data into a new file. More on this
later in the lesson.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Importing tabular data into R

There are several ways to import data into R. For our purpose here, we will
focus on using the tools every R installation comes with (so called "base" R) to
import a comma-delimited file containing the results of our variant calling workflow.
We will need to load the sheet using a function called `read.csv()`.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Exercise: Review the arguments of the `read.csv()` function

**Before using the `read.csv()` function, use R's help feature to answer the
following questions**.

*Hint*: Entering '?' before the function name and then running that line will
bring up the help documentation. Also, when reading this particular help
be careful to pay attention to the 'read.csv' expression under the 'Usage'
heading. Other answers will be in the 'Arguments' heading.

A) What is the default parameter for 'header' in the `read.csv()` function?

B) What argument would you have to change to read a file that was delimited
by semicolons (;) rather than commas?

C) What argument would you have to change to read file in which numbers
used commas for decimal separation (i.e. 1,00)?

D) What argument would you have to change to read in only the first 10,000 rows
of a very large file?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

A) The `read.csv()` function has the argument 'header' set to TRUE by default,
this means the function always assumes the first row is header information,
(i.e. column names)

B) The `read.csv()` function has the argument 'sep' set to ",". This means
the function assumes commas are used as delimiters, as you would expect.
Changing this parameter (e.g. `sep=";"`) would now interpret semicolons as
delimiters.

C) Although it is not listed in the `read.csv()` usage, `read.csv()` is
a "version" of the function `read.table()` and accepts all its arguments.
If you set `dec=","` you could change the decimal operator. We'd probably
assume the delimiter is some other character.

D) You can set `nrow` to a numeric value (e.g. `nrow=10000`) to choose how
many rows of a file you read in. This may be useful for very large files
where not all the data is needed to test some data cleaning steps you are
applying.

Hopefully, this exercise gets you thinking about using the provided help
documentation in R. There are many arguments that exist, but which we wont
have time to cover. Look here to get familiar with functions you use
frequently, you may be surprised at what you find they can do.


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Tip: Why does ?read.csv open the documentations to read.table?

The reason for this is because `read.csv` is actually a short cut
for `read.table("file.csv", sep = ",")`. You can see in the help
documentation that there are several additional variations of
`read.table`, such as `read.csv2` to read tables separated by `;`
and `read.delim` to read in tables separated by `\t` (tabs). If you know how your table is separated, you can use one of the provided short cuts,
but case you run into an unconventional separator you are now equipt with the knowledge to define it in the `sep = ` arugument of `read.table`!


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Now, let's read in the file `combined_tidy_vcf.csv` which will be located in
`/home/dcuser/r_data/`. Call this data `variants`. The
first argument to pass to our `read.csv()` function is the file path for our
data. The file path must be in quotes and now is a good time to remember to
use tab autocompletion. **If you use tab autocompletion you avoid typos and
errors in file paths.** Use it!

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
## read in a CSV file and save it as 'variants'

variants <- read.csv("/home/dcuser/r_data/combined_tidy_vcf.csv")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
## silently read in CSV file from FigShare

variants <- read.csv("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/14632895")
```

One of the first things you should notice is that in the Environment window,
you have the `variants` object, listed as 801 obs. (observations/rows)
of 29 variables (columns). Double-clicking on the name of the object will open
a view of the data in a new tab.

<img src="fig/rstudio_dataframeview.png" alt="rstudio data frame view" style="width: 1000px;"/>

## Summarizing, subsetting, and determining the structure of a data frame.

A **data frame is the standard way in R to store tabular data**. A data fame
could also be thought of as a collection of vectors, all of which have the same
length. Using only two functions, we can learn a lot about out data frame
including some summary statistics as well as well as the "structure" of the data
frame. Let's examine what each of these functions can tell us:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
## get summary statistics on a data frame

summary(variants)
```

Our data frame had 29 variables, so we get 29 fields that summarize the data.
The `QUAL`, `IMF`, and `VDB` variables (and several others) are
numerical data and so you get summary statistics on the min and max values for
these columns, as well as mean, median, and interquartile ranges. Many of the
other variables (e.g. `sample_id`) are treated as characters data (more on this
in a bit).

There is a lot to work with, so we will subset the first three columns into a
new data frame using the `data.frame()` function.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
## put the first three columns of variants into a new data frame called subset

subset<-data.frame(variants[,c(1:3,6)])
```

Now, let's use the `str()` (structure) function to look a little more closely
at how data frames work:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
## get the structure of a data frame

str(subset)
```

Ok, thats a lot up unpack! Some things to notice.

- the object type `data.frame` is displayed in the first row along with its
  dimensions, in this case 801 observations (rows) and 4 variables (columns)
- Each variable (column) has a name (e.g. `sample_id`). This is followed
  by the object mode (e.g. chr, int, etc.). Notice that before each
  variable name there is a `$` - this will be important later.



  :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

  ## Exercise: Revisiting modes and classess

  Remeber when we said mode and class are sometimes different? If you do, here
  is a chance to check. What happens when you try the following?

  1. `mode(variants)`
  2. `class(variants)`

  :::::::::::::::  solution

  ## Solution



  ```{r, purl=FALSE}
  mode(variants)
  ```



  ```{r, purl=FALSE}
  class(variants)
  ```

  This result makes sense because mode (which deals with how an object is stored)
  is treated as a **list** in R. A data frame is in some sense a "fancy" list.
  However, data fames do have some specific properties so they have their own
  class (**data.frame**) which is useful for functions (and programmers) to know.
  :::::::::::::::::::::::::

  ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Introducing Factors

Factors are the final major data structure we will introduce in our R genomics
lessons. Factors can be thought of as vectors which are specialized for
categorical data. Given R's specialization for statistics, this make sense since
categorial and continuous variables are usually treated differently. Sometimes
you may want to have data treated as a factor, but in other cases, this may be
undesirable.

Let's see the value of treating some of which are categorical in nature as
factors. Let's take a look at just the alternate alleles

```{r, purl=FALSE}
## extract the "ALT" column to a new object

alt_alleles <- subset$ALT
```

Let's look at the first few items in our factor using `head()`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
head(alt_alleles)
```

There are 801 alleles (one for each row). To simplify, lets look at just the
single-nuleotide alleles (SNPs). We can use some of the vector indexing skills
from the last episode.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
snps <- c(alt_alleles[alt_alleles=="A"],
  alt_alleles[alt_alleles=="T"],
  alt_alleles[alt_alleles=="G"],
  alt_alleles[alt_alleles=="C"])
```

This leaves us with a vector of the 701 alternative alleles which were single
nucleotides. Right now, they are being treated a characters, but we could treat
them as categories of SNP. Doing this will enable some nice features. For
example, we can try to generate a plot of this character vector as it is right
now:

```{r, purl=FALSE, fig.show="hide"}
plot(snps)
```

Whoops! Though the `plot()` function will do its best to give us a quick plot,
it is unable to do so here. One way to fix this it to tell R to treat the SNPs
as categories (i.e. a factor vector); we will create a new object to avoid
confusion using the `factor()` function:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
factor_snps <- factor(snps)
```

Let's learn a little more about this new type of vector:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
str(factor_snps)
```

What we get back are the categories ("A","C","G","T") in our factor; these are
called "Levels". **Levels are the different categories contained in a factor**.
By default, R will organize the levels in a factor in alphabetical order. So the
first level in this factor is "A".

For the sake of efficiency, R stores the content of a factor as a vector of
integers, which an integer is assigned to each of the possible levels. Recall
levels are assigned in alphabetical order. In this case, the first item in our
`factor_snps` object is "A", which happens to be the 1st level of our factor,
ordered alphabetically. This explains the sequence of "1"s ("Factor w/ 4 levels
"A","C","G","T": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ..."), since "A" is the first level, and
the first few items in our factor are all "A"s.

We can see how many items in our vector fall into each category:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
summary(factor_snps)
```

As you can imagine, this is already useful when you want to generate a tally.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Tip: treating objects as categories without changing their mode

You don't have to make an object a factor to get the benefits of treating
an object as a factor. See what happens when you use the `as.factor()`
function on `factor_snps`. To generate a tally, you can sometimes also use
the `table()` function; though sometimes you may need to combine both (i.e.
`table(as.factor(object))`)


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Plotting and ordering factors

One of the most common uses for factors will be when you plot categorical
values. For example, suppose we want to know how many of our variants had each
possible SNP we could generate a plot:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
plot(factor_snps)
```

This isn't a particularly pretty example of a plot but it works. We'll be
learning much more about creating nice, publication-quality graphics later in
this lesson.

If you recall, factors are ordered alphabetically. That might make sense, but
categories (e.g., "red", "blue", "green") often do not have an intrinsic order.
What if we wanted to order our plot according to the numerical value (i.e.,
in descending order of SNP frequency)? We can enforce an order on our factors:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
ordered_factor_snps <- factor(factor_snps, levels = names(sort(table(factor_snps))))
```

Let's deconstruct this from the inside out (you can try each of these commands
to see why this works):

1. We create a table of `factor_snps` to get the frequency of each SNP:
  `table(factor_snps)`
2. We sort this table: `sort(table(factor_snps))`; use the `decreasing =`
  parameter for this function if you wanted to change from the default of
  FALSE
3. Using the `names` function gives us just the character names of the table
  sorted by frequencies:`names(sort(table(factor_snps)))`
4. The `factor` function is what allows us to create a factor. We give it the
  `factor_snps` object as input, and use the `levels=` parameter to enforce the
  ordering of the levels.

Now we see our plot has be reordered:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
plot(ordered_factor_snps)
```

Factors come in handy in many places when using R. Even using more
sophisticated plotting packages such as ggplot2 will sometimes require you
to understand how to manipulate factors.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Tip: Packages in R -- what are they and why do we use them?

Packages are simply collections of functions and/or data that can be used to extend the
capabilities of R beyond the core functionality that comes with it by default. There are
useful R packages available that span all types of statistical analysis, data visualization,
and more. The main place that R packages are installed from is a website called
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) (the Comprehensive R Archive Network). Many thousands
of R packages are available there, and when you use the built-in R function `install.packages()`,
it will look for a CRAN repository to install from. So, for example, to install
[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) packages such as `dplyr` and `ggplot2`
(which you'll do in the next few lessons), you would use the following command:

```{r}
# install a package from CRAN
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Subsetting data frames

Next, we are going to talk about how you can get specific values from data frames, and where necessary, change the mode of a column of values.

The first thing to remember is that a data frame is two-dimensional (rows and
columns). Therefore, to select a specific value we will will once again use
`[]` (bracket) notation, but we will specify more than one value (except in some cases
where we are taking a range).

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Exercise: Subsetting a data frame

**Try the following indices and functions and try to figure out what they return**

a. `variants[1,1]`

b. `variants[2,4]`

c. `variants[801,29]`

d. `variants[2, ]`

e. `variants[-1, ]`

f. `variants[1:4,1]`

g. `variants[1:10,c("REF","ALT")]`

h. `variants[,c("sample_id")]`

i. `head(variants)`

j. `tail(variants)`

k. `variants$sample_id`

l. `variants[variants$REF == "A",]`

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

a.

```{r}
variants[1,1]
```

b.

```{r}
variants[2,4]
```

c.

```{r}
variants[801,29]
```

d.

```{r}
variants[2, ]
```

e.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
variants[-1, ]
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
head(variants[-1, ])
```

f.

```{r}
variants[1:4,1]
```

g.

```{r}
variants[1:10,c("REF","ALT")]
```

h.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
variants[,c("sample_id")]
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
head(variants[,c("sample_id")])
```

i.

```{r}
head(variants)
```

j.

```{r}
tail(variants)
```

k.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
variants$sample_id
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
head(variants$sample_id)
```

l.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
variants[variants$REF == "A",]
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
head(variants[variants$REF == "A",])
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The subsetting notation is very similar to what we learned for
vectors. The key differences include:

- Typically provide two values separated by commas: data.frame[row, column]
- In cases where you are taking a continuous range of numbers use a colon
  between the numbers (start:stop, inclusive)
- For a non continuous set of numbers, pass a vector using `c()`
- Index using the name of a column(s) by passing them as vectors using `c()`

Finally, in all of the subsetting exercises above, we printed values to
the screen. You can create a new data frame object by assigning
them to a new object name:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
# create a new data frame containing only observations from SRR2584863

SRR2584863_variants <- variants[variants$sample_id == "SRR2584863",]

# check the dimension of the data frame

dim(SRR2584863_variants)

# get a summary of the data frame

summary(SRR2584863_variants)
```

## Coercing values in data frames

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Tip: coercion isn't limited to data frames

While we are going to address coercion in the context of data frames
most of these methods apply to other data structures, such as vectors


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Sometimes, it is possible that R will misinterpret the type of data represented
in a data frame, or store that data in a mode which prevents you from
operating on the data the way you wish. For example, a long list of gene names
isn't usually thought of as a categorical variable, the way that your
experimental condition (e.g. control, treatment) might be. More importantly,
some R packages you use to analyze your data may expect characters as input,
not factors. At other times (such as plotting or some statistical analyses) a
factor may be more appropriate. Ultimately, you should know how to change the
mode of an object.

First, its very important to recognize that coercion happens in R all the time.
This can be a good thing when R gets it right, or a bad thing when the result
is not what you expect. Consider:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
snp_chromosomes <- c('3', '11', 'X', '6')
typeof(snp_chromosomes)
```

Although there are several numbers in our vector, they are all in quotes, so
we have explicitly told R to consider them as characters. However, even if we removed
the quotes from the numbers, R would coerce everything into a character:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
snp_chromosomes_2 <- c(3, 11, 'X', 6)
typeof(snp_chromosomes_2)
snp_chromosomes_2[1]
```

We can use the `as.` functions to explicitly coerce values from one form into
another. Consider the following vector of characters, which all happen to be
valid numbers:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
snp_positions_2 <- c("8762685", "66560624", "67545785", "154039662")
typeof(snp_positions_2)
snp_positions_2[1]
```

Now we can coerce `snp_positions_2` into a numeric type using `as.numeric()`:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
snp_positions_2 <- as.numeric(snp_positions_2)
typeof(snp_positions_2)
snp_positions_2[1]
```

Sometimes coercion is straight forward, but what would happen if we tried
using `as.numeric()` on `snp_chromosomes_2`

```{r, purl=FALSE}
snp_chromosomes_2 <- as.numeric(snp_chromosomes_2)
```

If we check, we will see that an `NA` value (R's default value for missing
data) has been introduced.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
snp_chromosomes_2
```

Trouble can really start when we try to coerce a factor. For example, when we
try to coerce the `factor_snps` vector into a numeric mode
look at the result:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
as.numeric(factor_snps)
```

Strangely, it works! Almost. Instead of giving an error message, R returns
numeric values, which in this case are the integers assigned to the levels in
this factor. This kind of behavior can lead to hard-to-find bugs, for example
when we do have numbers in a factor, and we get numbers from a coercion. If
we don't look carefully, we may not notice a problem.

If you need to coerce an entire column you can overwrite it using an expression
like this one:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
# make the 'REF' column a character type column

variants$REF <- as.character(variants$REF)

# check the type of the column
typeof(variants$REF)
```

## StringsAsFactors = ?

Lets summarize this section on coercion with a few take home messages.

- When you explicitly coerce one data type into another (this is known as
  **explicit coercion**), be careful to check the result. Ideally, you should try to see if its possible to avoid steps in your analysis that force you to
  coerce.
- R will sometimes coerce without you asking for it. This is called
  (appropriately) **implicit coercion**. For example when we tried to create
  a vector with multiple data types, R chose one type through implicit
  coercion.
- Check the structure (`str()`) of your data frames before working with them!

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  callout

## Tip: coercion isn't limited to data frames

Prior to R 4.0 when importing a data frame using any one of the `read.table()`
functions such as `read.csv()` , the argument `StringsAsFactors` was by
default
set to true TRUE. Setting it to FALSE will treat any non-numeric column to
a character type. `read.csv()` documentation, you will also see you can
explicitly type your columns using the `colClasses` argument. Other R packages
(such as the Tidyverse "readr") don't have this particular conversion issue,
but many packages will still try to guess a data type.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Data frame bonus material: math, sorting, renaming

Here are a few operations that don't need much explanation, but which are good
to know.

There are lots of arithmetic functions you may want to apply to your data
frame, covering those would be a course in itself (there is some starting
material in [the _Loops in R_ episode of one of the Software Carpentry lessons](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/15-supp-loops-in-depth.html)). Our lessons will cover some additional summary statistical functions in
a subsequent lesson, but overall we will focus on data cleaning and
visualization.

You can use functions like `mean()`, `min()`, `max()` on an
individual column. Let's look at the "DP" or filtered depth. This value shows the number of filtered
reads that support each of the reported variants.

```{r, purl=FALSE}
max(variants$DP)
```

You can sort a data frame using the `order()` function:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
sorted_by_DP <- variants[order(variants$DP), ]
head(sorted_by_DP$DP)
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Exercise

The `order()` function lists values in increasing order by default. Look at
the documentation for this function and change `sorted_by_DP` to start with
variants with the greatest filtered depth ("DP").

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```{r, purl=FALSE}
   sorted_by_DP <- variants[order(variants$DP, decreasing = TRUE), ]
   head(sorted_by_DP$DP)
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

You can rename columns:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
colnames(variants)[colnames(variants) == "sample_id"] <- "strain"

# check the column name (hint names are returned as a vector)
colnames(variants)
```

## Saving your data frame to a file

We can save data to a file. We will save our `SRR2584863_variants` object
to a .csv file using the `write.csv()` function:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
write.csv(SRR2584863_variants, file = "data/SRR2584863_variants.csv")
```

The `write.csv()` function has some additional arguments listed in the help, but
at a minimum you need to tell it what data frame to write to file, and give a
path to a file name in quotes (if you only provide a file name, the file will
be written in the current working directory).

## Importing data from Excel

Excel is one of the most common formats, so we need to discuss how to make
these files play nicely with R. The simplest way to import data from Excel is
to **save your Excel file in .csv format**\*. You can then import into R right
away. Sometimes you may not be able to do this (imagine you have data in 300
Excel files, are you going to open and export all of them?).

One common R package (a set of code with features you can download and add to
your R installation) is the [readxl package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=readxl) which can open and import Excel
files. Rather than addressing package installation this second (we'll discuss this soon!), we can take
advantage of RStudio's import feature which integrates this package. (Note:
this feature is available only in the latest versions of RStudio such as is
installed on our cloud instance).

First, in the RStudio menu go to **File**, select **Import Dataset**, and
choose **From Excel...** (notice there are several other options you can
explore).

<img src="fig/rstudio_import_menu.png " alt="rstudio import menu" style="width: 600px;"/>

Next, under **File/Url:** click the <KBD>Browse</KBD> button and navigate to the **Ecoli\_metadata.xlsx** file located at `/home/dcuser/dc_sample_data/R`.
You should now see a preview of the data to be imported:

<img src="fig/rstudio_import_screen.png " alt="rstudio import screen" style="width: 1200px;"/>

Notice that you have the option to change the data type of each variable by
clicking arrow (drop-down menu) next to each column title. Under **Import
Options** you may also rename the data, choose a different sheet to import, and
choose how you will handle headers and skipped rows. Under **Code Preview** you
can see the code that will be used to import this file. We could have written
this code and imported the Excel file without the RStudio import function, but
now you can choose your preference.

In this exercise, we will leave the title of the data frame as
**Ecoli\_metadata**, and there are no other options we need to adjust. Click the
<KBD>Import</KBD> button to import the data.

Finally, let's check the first few lines of the `Ecoli_metadata` data
frame:

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, purl=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## silently read in CSV file from CyVerse
download.file("https://de.cyverse.org/dl/d/17FAE062-2673-417B-8544-77CC46974A37/Ecoli_metadata.xlsx",
              destfile = "Ecoli_metadata.xlsx")
Ecoli_metadata <- readxl::read_xlsx("Ecoli_metadata.xlsx")
```

```{r, purl=FALSE}
head(Ecoli_metadata)
```

The type of this object is 'tibble', a type of data
frame we will talk more about in the 'dplyr' section. If you needed
a true R data frame you could coerce with `as.data.frame()`.

## Exercise: Putting it all together - data frames

**Using the `Ecoli_metadata` data frame created above, answer the following questions**

A) What are the dimensions (# rows, # columns) of the data frame?

B) What are categories are there in the `cit` column? *hint*: treat column as factor

C) How many of each of the `cit` categories are there?

D) What is the genome size for the 7th observation in this data set?

E) What is the median value of the variable `genome_size`

F) Rename the column `sample` to `sample_id`

G) Create a new column (name genome\_size\_bp) and set it equal to the genome\_size multiplied by 1,000,000

H) Save the edited Ecoli\_metadata data frame as "exercise\_solution.csv" in your current working directory.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```{r, purl=FALSE}
dim(Ecoli_metadata)
levels(as.factor(Ecoli_metadata$cit))
table(as.factor(Ecoli_metadata$cit))
Ecoli_metadata[7,7]
median(Ecoli_metadata$genome_size)
colnames(Ecoli_metadata)[colnames(Ecoli_metadata) == "sample"] <- "sample_id"
Ecoli_metadata$genome_size_bp <- Ecoli_metadata$genome_size * 1000000
write.csv(Ecoli_metadata, file = "exercise_solution.csv")
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- It is easy to import data into R from tabular formats including Excel. However, you still need to check that R has imported and interpreted your data correctly
- There are best practices for organizing your data (keeping it tidy) and R is great for this
- Base R has many useful functions for manipulating your data, but all of R's capabilities are greatly enhanced by software packages developed by the community
