# Data Analysis and Visualization with R for Genomics

Lesson in development.

## How to contribute?

This repository uses GitHub Actions to build and deploy the lesson.

Contributions and Pull Requests should be made against the `main` branch. After your contribution is merged, GitHub Actions will take care of using R to process the Rmd files into markdown files, and push them into the `gh-branch` which GitHub uses to serve the lesson website.

Individual episode files are in the `episodes` folder.
